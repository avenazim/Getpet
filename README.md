### Design brief:

Overcrowded animal shelters are an overwhelming reality throughout whole Poland. Additional difficulty for a potential adopter it to obtain information about all the animals in their area. Since only small percentage of the shelters/foundations share their pupils descriptions online -  they would have to travel from foundation to foundation and shelter to shelter to find the perfect companion. In recent years, the world has become very digital, therefore our idea for a global animal database in cooperation with every interested foundation or shelter would a great help for everyone.

We contacted two random shelters in each province to ask if a global database of animals in shelters were created, would they want to be a part of it. The feedback was 100% positive.

As part of the project, we also created a business model, strategy and preliminary profit forecast.
